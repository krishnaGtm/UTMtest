Dear User, 
<br />
<br/>

For $Model.PlatePlanName$ , UTM is not able to create observation records due to too many columns in the field. Please add the observation columns to receive the marker data. After adding the needed observation columns, you will receive and email when all the data is in Phenome.<br/><br/>

Best Regards, <br/>
UTM
